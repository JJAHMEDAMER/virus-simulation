# Covid-19 (Virus) Simulator

This project aims to simulate virus spreed among a group of people in different zones. The zones limit the spread of the virus because of lower number of sick in each zone

<br />

## Single Zone Simulation

The Lack of zones exposes everyone to sick people which increases the chance of infection. This results in faster spread as shown below

<br />

| Number Of      | Value |   |   |   |
|----------------|-------|---|---|---|
| Healthy People | 25000 |   |   |   |
| Sick People    | 25    |   |   |   |
| Zones          | 1     |   |   |   |
| Days           | 100   |   |   |   |

## Multi Zone Simulation
Having Multiple zones limits the interaction between people and limits the spread of the virus, this create a gradual increase in the sick rate

<br />

| Number Of      | Value |   |   |   |
|----------------|-------|---|---|---|
| Healthy People | 25000 |   |   |   |
| Sick People    | 25    |   |   |   |
| Days           | 100   |   |   |   |

### Note that by the end everyone was infected and recovered but by social distancing the curve was flatten and the number of sick people at a given moment was less when social distancing.
